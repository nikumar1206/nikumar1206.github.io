# Top 5 VSCode Extensions for JS Devs

If you’re a JS developer in 2024, chances are you’re using VS Code and for good reason. There just isn’t an IDE that is as jam-packed with features, while still feeling light. Here are the top 5 VS Code extensions that can help you become a more productive JS developer.

### 1. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

This one is simple, but fundamental to any web developer. Live Server allows you to set up a local dev server with auto-reload! Simply right-click your HTML file of choice and hit “Open with Live Server”.

### 2. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

Too often we write code that doesn’t use consistent formatting, which decreases our code’s readability and our suave as JS developers. Enter Prettier, an opinionated code-formatter. On save (make sure this is enabled in settings), Prettier will parse our code and re-print it according to rules it thinks are best.

Don’t like those rules? You can create a prettier configuration file to make your code look exactly the way you want it to. More info can be found in the docs.

### 3. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

Are you tired of manually checking your code for errors or inconsistencies? Well, you’re in luck because I’ve got just the tool for you — ESLint! It’s an open-source linter that can save you a lot of time and effort in maintaining code quality.

And the best part? It’s completely customizable via a .eslintrc file. More info on the setup here.

### 4. [ES6 Code Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)

Take this line of code:

```javascript
for(const item of object) {
  // cool stuff here!
}
```

A simple loop meant to iterate over the items present in an object. Instead of writing that entire line out what if we could just write “fof” ( for … of loop ) and it would give us the same line of code? Well that’s the magic behind code snippets and there are tons more where that came from!

### 5. [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)

Not the craziest tool out there, but still useful nonetheless. As JavaScript developers, its very rare that we write all the code ourselves, and more than likely import libraries/frameworks/modules that can help us get our work done faster.

That’s where Import Cost comes in handy. It can help us estimate the impact of imports on an application’s performance and potentially find places where we can optimize.

Do note that the import costs are just estimates. They don’t account for the performance optimizations that may occur during the build process or factor in the other dependancies that these modules may rely on.

There’s obviously tons more really cool extensions, I just chose to focus on these 5 for now. Honorable mentions go to: GitLens, RestClient, JavaScript Booster, and Quokka.Js.

That’s all for now!!
